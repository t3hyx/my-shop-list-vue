## *Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite*

This project aims to become a **life-helper**, 
-- (*yea, one can be stupid enough to always forgot somthing when going on groceries*) --
as well as a *good* (completely ~~objective~~ statement...) starting point to my **VueJS** / **Typescript** ~~journey~~ adventure.
